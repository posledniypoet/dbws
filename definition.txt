in my table system there are two logical parts: the first is associated with tasks, the second is associated with students and entities. The first part will have 4 tables: one for message data( reload_message_tab), which is connected via message_id to reload_jobs_tab, the table itself for tasks and two tables for tasks by type. The second part will consist of 6 tables, the common part for the student and lecturer entities will be a person, whose identifiers will refer to the person identifier, there will be an objects entity, which will be associated with the lecturer_id, there will be a group entity, which will simply carry an additional informative part and the main one for us entity is an assessment whose primary key will be based on student and subject identifiers.
