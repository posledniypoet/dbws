Databases and web services

In my understanding, my web project will have a classic database system with non-standard usage. I will have the classic entities for such projects: Student, Teacher, Course, Group, Grade, Subject; non-classical tables will be added to them for storing message data by date, identifier, the message data itself and a table for jobs. In short, my web service will have a consumer for consuming two types of messages: by ID and by date. Messages by ID will come with the IDs of students whose grades will need to be reload with complete data about the group, teacher and subject. Messages by date will arrive with a date range, and the service will have to re-upload data in this range about the same student results. Reloading will occur every certain period of time, that is, the logic of consuming a task message about reloading and processing this message will be separated. The first part, related to message consumption, in my understanding, is seen either using a message broker or using RESTAP, the second part, related to reloading, will be based on the usual method with scheduling. From the user's point of view, we will have a transparent standard API with encapsulated business logic. The client will have only two standard messages (by date and by identifier)
